# Minesweeper in Godot

Six years after making [Minesweeper in MonkeyX](https://github.com/marleysudbury/minesweeper-monkeyx) for my A level Computer Science project, and five years after [remaking it in Pygame](https://github.com/marleysudbury/minesweeper-pygame), I have decided to do it all again, from scratch, in an actual game engine: Godot 4!

# Minesweeper in Godot

Six years after making [Minesweeper in MonkeyX](https://github.com/marleysudbury/minesweeper-monkeyx) for my A level Computer Science project, and five years after [remaking it in Pygame](https://github.com/marleysudbury/minesweeper-pygame), I have decided to do it all again, from scratch, in an actual game engine: Godot 4!

The latest version of main branch is automatically built with Github Actions and is playable in the browser at <https://marleysudbury.github.io/minesweeper-godot>
